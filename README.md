# World Weather Analysis

The premise of the challenge was to modify the PlanMyTrop app to provide a more convenient trip planning experience for the customer. 
The first modification was made by adding weather description to the weather data collected previously. This can be seen through the work found within the 'Weather_Database' folder. 
The next modification was made to allow the customer to input statements to filter the data for their specific weather preferences. This would then be used to locate potential travel destinations within the specified preference. The specified modification can be found within the 'Vacation_Search' folder.
The final modification was to choose four cities, from the previously filtered destination, and create a travel itinerary. A travel route was created between the four cities, along with a marker layer map, using the Google Maps Directions API. This modification can be seen through the work found in the 'Vacation_Itinerary' folder.
